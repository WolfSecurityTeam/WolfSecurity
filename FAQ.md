<h1> What is DDoS/DoS </h1>

A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to obstruct a server, service, or network's regular traffic by saturating the target or its surrounding infrastructure with an excessive amount of Internet traffic.

By using numerous compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic, DDoS attacks are made effective. Computers and other networked resources, like as IoT devices, can be exploited machines.



When viewed from a distance, a DDoS assault resembles an unexpected traffic congestion that blocks the roadway and keeps ordinary traffic from reaching its destination.

DDoS assaults are conducted using networks of computers linked to the Internet.

These networks are made up of computers and other gadgets that have been infected with malware, enabling an attacker to remotely manipulate them. These individual machines are known as bots, and a botnet is a collection of bots.

Once a botnet has been created, the attacker can control an attack by giving each bot remote commands.

Each bot in the botnet sends queries to the IP address of the victim's server or network when that server or network is being targeted by the botnet. This could overload the server or network and result in a denial-of-service attack on regular traffic.

It might be challenging to distinguish attack traffic from regular traffic because each bot is an actual Internet device.
